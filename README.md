# iPhone Components Challenge

This project showcases the implementation of the iPhone components: Music Player, Phone, and Web Browser. It includes a basic structure for classes and interfaces to simulate the functionalities of these components.

## Challenge Guideline

The project was created based on the challenge that involved modeling and diagramming the representation of iPhone components using UML and implementing the classes and interfaces according to the roles of the iPhone: Music Player, Phone, and Web Browser. The challenge was inspired by the iPhone launch video from 2007, focusing on specific behaviors such as music playback, phone functionalities, and web browsing.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


- `apps`: Contains the implementations of the specific classes for each component, such as MobilePhone, MusicPlayer, and WebBrowser.
- `interfaces`: Contains the interfaces that define the contracts for each component, such as MobilePhoneInterface, MusicPlayerInterface, and WebBrowserInterface.
- `utils`: Contains utility classes that provide generic functionality, including ActionFunction and classes like MusicPlayerActions, MobilePhoneActions, and WebBrowserActions.
- `Iphone.java`: The main file that demonstrates the usage of the components and actions.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run `Iphone.java` to see the simulated actions of the iPhone components.
3. Make sure you have Java 8 or a later version installed to run the code.

For more details on each component's behavior, refer to the individual implementation files and interface contracts.

This project was created as part of a programming challenge to model iPhone components using UML, implement the classes and interfaces, and demonstrate the specified behaviors.
